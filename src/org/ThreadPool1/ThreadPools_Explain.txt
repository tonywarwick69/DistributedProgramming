thread pools provide a convenient and efficient way to manage concurrent execution in multi-threaded applications,
leading to better performance, resource utilization, and scalability.
Thread pools are used for several reasons:
Resource Management: reduce resources costing
Concurrency Control: In applications that require concurrent execution of multiple tasks, thread pools help control the number of threads running simultaneously.
Performance Optimization: improve the performance of applications by reducing the latency associated with thread creation
Load Balancing:
