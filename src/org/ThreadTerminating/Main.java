        Multithreads seem to run parallel, mean the two messages or threads are interleaved but in actually sometime some thread my jump ahead of another and break the order
        This mean even with the thread scheduler like Thread.sleep it still give NO GUARANTEE whether the threads running in same orders.
        If the sleep time is over but the current thread still running it job then the next thread will be started anyway.
